# Community

2i2c Interactive Computing is designed around the concept of a Community.  These prompts are used to decribe a Community.

Q: What do you want to achieve by working with 2i2c? Can you paint me a picture that describes the future you wish to materialize?

Q: Can you describe this research community more? Is it segmented? Are there archetypes or personas?

Q: At a high level, what is your community trying to achieve and how open data/compute infrastructure will help advance toward your mission/vision?

Q: Can you describe the data? Collaborating open science communities orbit around the heaviest objects in their science space -- their data. Where is it?
