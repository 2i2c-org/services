Email to send to community representatives

```
Welcome to 2i2c's Advanced Tier,

Our infrastructure team will schedule the deployment and rollout of a JupyterHub for your community.
To kick-off this process, may we schedule a technical meeting with you to align on the infrastructure requirements?

The purpose of this meeting is to make some technical choices about how 2i2c should deploy infrastructure on your community’s behalf. 
If applicable, please invite to this meeting representatives from your community who will be able to speak to the technical or policy requirements for deploying cloud infrastructure on behalf of your commuity.

Please select a time that is convenient for you using https://cal.com/jmunroe/30min . 

Here are the topics we need to align on as an outcome of this technical meeting:
- Choice of cloud provider and region
- Discuss options on authentication
- Discuss GitHub organizations and teams

After this meeting, the 2i2c will proceed with the deployment process. Once these hubs are available, 2i2c will invite your community a formal rollout meeting where we will demo the infrastructure and align on next steps.

Our team works on a two week iteration model. Our next iteration period is for <date> to <date> and we commit to having your hubs provisionally deployed by the end of that iteration.

Kind regards,
2i2c Product and Services Team
