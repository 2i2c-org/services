# Managed Iteractive Computing Service

Deployment and management of JupyterHub-infrastructure on cloud infrastructure for Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and NSF Jetstream2. 2i2c offers a number of features with our JupyterHub service including CPU/RAM configuration options, multiple authentication options, image management, dynamic image building, multiple hubs domains, configurable landing pages, usage analytics, cloud costs pass through, service documentation, uptime monitoring, and cloud storage configuration. This infrastructure is served through a monorepo with configuration details (with secrets and authentication tokens securely encrypted) visible to all communities. This fulfills 2i2câ€™s commitment to the Right to Replicate. Improvements to the platforms are upstreamed though the Jupyter project for the collective benefit of all JupyterHub communities.
