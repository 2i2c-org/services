# services-wip

**Hypothesis: By communicating with the 2i2c team using this [services-wip](https://github.com/2i2c-org/services-wip) repository there will increased alignment on the current and future state of 2i2 service design work.**

This repository supports service design work in progress (WIP).  

@jmunroe had been using the Google Drive folder [Services](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1WAFsDbgZkNNU6khJ_jGyiAoGk7mJHjH1) as a working space for WIP but it was unclear to the rest of the 2i2c team what is the current, latest, and single source of truth for service design work.  

The intent of this repository is to treat "2i2c Services" as a internal product to track the development and refinement of services.

This repository is private to represent the work in progress characteristic of 2i2c services.  It is an attempt to avoid confusion with our communities between 'what we offer' and 'what we might offer' in terms of our services.

The public version of a 2i2c service will be released using the following sites:
- [2i2c Team Compass](https://compass.2i2c.org) . As 2i2c's primary source of truth, the operational details and procedures of all services will be published to the Team Compass. Pushing to the Team Compass indicates that a particular version of a service has been released and can be trusted both internally and externally as the official documentation of how a service is intended to work. For services, the Team Compass defines *how* a service is implemented. The intended audience is the 2i2c Team.
- [Service Guide](https://docs.2i2c.org) . This is the documentation that 2i2c makes available to its communities and users about what they should expect from our interactive computing platform.  As services are integral to the socio-technical platform that are made available to commuities, they need to be fully described in the Service Guide. For services, the Service Guide define *what* a service is and what should be expected by communities. The intended audience is current 2i2c communities and users.
- [2i2c Brochure Website](https://2i2c.org) . This is site explains the value proposition of 2i2c's platform and services. For services, the Brochure Website defines *why* a service is offered and demonstrates the intended value to communities and buyers considering joining the 2i2c network.  The intended audience is potential 2i2c communities.

A service needs to be consistently described and documented across all three web sites to be considered *done*.  

## Goals of this repository

1. Clearly answers the question 'What are the 2i2c Services" being developed.
2. Make the processes used in service design more discoverable across the 2i2c team.
3. A versioned storage area for artifacts created during the service design process.
4. Issues to record the historicaly decision making process that led to different service design choices. 

## FAQs

1.  *What is a Service?* Here is a working definition from a service design textbook (Penin, 2018, An Introduction to Service Design)
> "In economic terms, service occurs when there’s a value exchange between parts. One part, the service provider, performs a certain activity that results in some beneﬁt that includes a speciﬁc output and involves certain experiences. The other part, the service user, sees value in the output, the experience, or both combined and is willing to pay for it or exchange for something else of equivalent value."
  
3. *How does this repository different from ProductBoard?* Services are what we are deliverying to 2i2c. A service needs alignment across the entire 2i2c team throughout its entire development life cycle.  ProductBoard remains a useful tool for identifying the drivers for different services and collecting insights about potential services.
